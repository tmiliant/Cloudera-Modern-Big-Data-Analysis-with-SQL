# Cloudera-Modern-Big-Data-Analysis-with-SQL
Learned about Big Data storage/processing with Hive/Impala, HDFS, MapReduce, in-depth SQL with Hue.

- Traditional RDBMSs
- DDL, DML, DQL, DCL
- NULL values, primary keys, foreign keys
- operational and analytic databases
- normalizated and denormalized tables
- structured, semi-structured and unstructured data

- Big Data: Distributed Storage and Processing
- the MapReduce framework - understanding Map tasks and Reduce tasks: map -> shuffle and sort -> reduce 
- daemons for the faster Impala to reduce memory latency (so it does not use MapReduce)
- execution plans 
- the metastore with metadata
- worked with Apache Hive and Impala using Hue
- query optimization
- table partitioning
- Parquet/Avro files

-SQL in Hive/Impala with clauses:
  SELECT
  FROM
  WHERE
  GROUP BY
  HAVING
  ORDER BY
  LIMIT
  +
  UNION
  +
  JOIN: inner join, full join, left outer join, right outer join, cross join
  +
  handling NULL values
  
- create table from Hue or by using SQL statements
- CTAS, views - materialized/non-materialized
- data types
- Sqoop
- load data from the terminal
- gained experience with directories/subdirectories where the databases/tables reside, fast search through the files to find relevant data
